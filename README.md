The flow cytometry dataset for this project was provided by J. Neumann, Dr. S. Humblet-Baron, and Dr. L. Yshii (KU Leuven). The participant population comprised 143 males and 158 females aged between 40-83 years old. Participants were further characterized by clinical measures including age, age at diagnosis, and Mini‚ÄêMental State Examination (MMSE) score at the time of diagnosis.
